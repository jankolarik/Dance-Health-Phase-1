        <h2>User Testing and Design</h2>

        <h3>Testing Strategy</h3>
        <p>Our testing strategy has been clear from the beginning, and was outlined by the philosophy of agile development, specifically continuous testing.
            To put it simply, this is a testing strategy of testing early, often and everywhere.</p>
      <p>In the next couple of sections, we will explain the types of tests that we have conducted. Chosen supporting data on these tests can then be found at <a href="#testing">Test Cases & Feedback from testers and project partners</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>Unit and integration testing</h3>
        <p>To a certain extent, we have also done unit and integration testing. This is because we have testing the individual components, such as the Apple Watch, the Kinect and the server individually.
            After thoroughly testing these components, we have tested these systems integrated such as when we send data from the Kinect and Apple Watch to the server.</p>
        
        <h3>Compatibility Testing</h3>
        <p>We have tested the Apple Watch code on all of the Apple Watch Series in the XCode Simulator, since we did not have them on hand physically.</p>

        <h3>Responsive Design testing</h3>
        <p>Responsiveness design testing was only useful for the Apple Watch code by using the Apple Watch simulator which the users tested on.
            They tried to use different version/options of the UI and provided spoken feedback for each. This type of testing led to the final design of the Apple Watch UI.
            For example, the users wanted to see live data on the display as well as being to view the data after.
            Therefore, the UI was modified to be able to display live user health statistics throughout the session.</p>
        
        <h3>Performance/Stress testing</h3>
        <p>We were unable to perform effective stress testing due to hardware limitations as we only disposed with one Apple Watch and two Kinects.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless we have tried to type in session data manually as well as send it through the devices at the same time,
            along with creating many sessions in a very short period. Even though this was not idea, it is the best we could do in this situation.</p>
        
        <h2>User Acceptance Testing</h2>
      <div id="testing">
        <h3>Test Cases & Feedback from testers and project partners</h3>
      <p>We user-tested our whole system on 5 users, fitting the Jakob Nielsen <a href="appendices.html">[1]</a> suggestion that 3 to 5 evaluators is optimal.
          Despite them being our friends, we told them ot be as harsh as they wanted and not to hold back. Here's what they had to say:</p>

        <h2>Functionality Testing</h2>
        <p>This type of testing happened during the development process: for each new method we created, we tested its functionality in a variety of situations and made sure it produced repeatable and reliable results. </p>

        <h3>Kinect - Basic Skeletal Tracking and Obtaining Joint Co-ordiante</h3>
        <p><b>Test method</b>: having user performing actions at different position to the camera.</p>
        <p><b>Test result</b>: </p>
        <table style="width:100%" >
          <colspn>
          <tr>
            <th width="25%"></th>
            <th width="25%">X Co-ordinate</th>
            <th width="25%">Y Co-ordinate</th>
            <th width="25%">Z Co-ordinate</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Position 1</th>
            <td>-0.195</td>
            <td>0.796</td>
            <td>2.012</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Position 2</th>
            <td>0.451</td>
            <td>0.779</td>
            <td>2.124</td>
          </tr>
          </colspn>
        </table>
        <p><b>Comment</b>: the co-ordiantes of each joint are obtained successfully. As you can see from the table from position 1 to 2, when users move from the left of camera to the right,
            the X co-ordinate (horizontal distance) changes but Y (height) and Z (vertical distance) remains about the same. However, if the joint is
          behind the body or other object so that it can not be seen by the camera, the co-ordinate of that joint will be random value and keeps changing.</p>


        <h3>Kinect - Activity Level</h3>
        <p>Activity level is a method that calculate the average displacement of each joint moved between per frame; we can use this result to determine how active the person in front the camera is.</p>
        <p><b>Test method</b>: having user performing actions at different active level.</p>
        <p><b>Test result</b>:</p>
        <table style="width:100%" >
          <colspn>
          <tr>
            <th width="25%"></th>
            <th width="25%">Stand Still</th>
            <th width="25%">Gentle Movement</th>
            <th width="25%">Vigorous Movement</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Test 1</th>
            <td>0.001</td>
            <td>0.016</td>
            <td>0.116</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Test 2</th>
            <td>0.002</td>
            <td>0.014</td>
            <td>0.132</td>
          </tr>
          </colspn>
        </table>
        <p><b>Comment</b>: the value is almost zero when the user stands still and the faster and the further user moves, the higher the activity level value.</p>
        <p><b>Video</b>:</p>
        <iframe width="700" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/imnZaDlHTk4?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      
        
        <h3>Kinect - Joint Angle</h3>
        <p>The angle between different joints can be calculated when the joint name is provided, however, some joint angles are set to be the angle between the two joints specified (which forms a bone) and the person's body (which is obtained by the top, middle, and bottom spine joints).</p>
        <p><b>Test method</b>: having user performing actions at different angle.</p>
        <p><b>Test result</b>:</p>
        <table style="width:100%" >
          <colspn>
          <tr>
            <th width="1/3"></th>
            <th width="1/3">Right angle</th>
            <th width="1/3">Parallel</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Right Shoulder Joint</th>
            <td>81°-97°</td>
            <td>7°-9°</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Right Elbow Joint</th>
            <td>87°-93°</td>
            <td>177°-179°</td>
          </tr>
          </colspn>
        </table>
        <p><b>Comment</b>: The angle result can successfully represent the actual angle between joints. As the table shows, the results are not stable and can have a small range of error, this is due to the fact that we observed joint angles
            by using the bones, but the Kinect calculates it using joint positions, so its result angle may not be fully realistic.</p>

        <h3>Apple Watch - No of Spins</h3>
        <p>We have a method using the gyroscope and accelerometer inside the apple watch to identify the number of turns the person performed.</p>
        <p><b>Test method</b>: having a person perform by turning at different angles and speeds, and comparing the results with the amount of spins that actually happened.</p>
        <p><b>Test result</b>: </p>
        <table style="width:100%" >

            <td>46</td>
          </tr>
          </colspn>
        </table>
        <p><b>Comment</b>: In most condition the turns are recognised properly, however when you are turning too fast, the method result appears to be higher than the actual result.</p>

        <h3>Kinect - Video Saving and Skeletal Mapping</h3>
        <p>Our system saves a video each time: we checked the video saved (and watched the live feed) to identify and fix bugs. Here's an example:</p>
        <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15uQadY095dB5XhxMJdr16QDni86ukpjN/preview" width="640" height="400"></iframe>

        <br>

        <h3>Kinect System Testing: studio setting with dancing - User Acceptance Testing</h3>
        <p>We set up the UCL South Cloisters (where various University Dance groups often practice and choreograph performances) as if it were a studio, using the software we created.
        <br>
        This was a full Kinect system test, with a typical user: our friend Rachel (who is a dancer) got to test our system and give us feedback.</p>
        <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QQNdhhYA3mjogD_VgyumFYZGparGRjXb/preview" width="700" height="480"></iframe>

        <br>

        <h3>Session ID: Apple Watch testing</h3>
        <p>When we decided to implement a user-entered Session ID, we tested how feasible this was on the Apple Watch:</p>
        <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W_cd7An9N0_4t6vRawbUgqx4dDBxhnOQ/preview" width="700" height="480"></iframe>
      <br>
      <h3>Note:</h3>
      We were still in the testing and designing phase of our project when we produced this video for prototype 1:
      <br>
           <iframe width="700" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DocRgFNEgak" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <br>It shows the Apple Watch spin feature in great detail, which we were testing at the time.<br>
