        <h3>Gathering Requirements</h3>
        <p>We chose to use a semi-structured interview with two pseudo-users because, according to Chapter 7.4.2 of Interaction Design by Preece et. al., a semi-structured 
          format can help us “combine the features of structured and unstructured interviews and get more information we interested on the basic of preplanned questions.”</p>
        
        <h3>Interview I</h3>
        <p><b>Do you mind being filmed while dancing?</b></p>
        <p>No, because I’m already pretty used to being tracked as I own wearables, I don’t really mind as long as the data is for me only.</p>
        <p><b>You mentioned wearables, what type of health data do you hope to get out of using this product?</b></p>
        <p>At the moment, because of my mobility and my injury, I really hope to track the progress of my fitness adn my steps and whatnot, but I think the dancing improvements would be a cool addition as well.</p>
        <p><b>Do you think you have enough knowledge on rehabilitation to track it effectively?</b></p>
        <p>I’m not a medical professional so I don’t really have enough knowledge to know for sure, but I hear dancing is a great way to improve mobility, so as long as I don’t injure myself further, I think it can only bring good things.</p>
        <p><b>After you leg heals, would you still be interested in using this product?</b></p>
        <p>That entirely depends on how my dancing improves afterwards. If i’m really engaged I want to use it to improve.</p>
        
        <h3>Interview II</h3>
        <p><b>Hi, tell me a little more about yourself and what exactly you do?</b></p>
        <p>I am a dance instructor and performer. I mostly a performed when I was younger but now I am more of a instructor</p>
        <p><b>Do you think dancing is beneficial to your health?</b></p>
        <p>Definitely, it raises endorphins, it makes people happy, but also keeps you active, with lots of cardio. And it’s great for mental health. I never met an unhappy dancer!</p>
        <p><b>What information do you track about the metrics of your practises at the moment, and what would you like to track in the future?</b></p>
        <p>I have an Apple Watch, which measures some things; but when I heard about this idea, I heard I could get more information than just my step count or my calories, and it could improve my dancing, but I have no idea what to expect. Maybe it could do something for my posture?</p>
        <p><b>Would you want software to improve your dance abilities?</b></p>
        <p>I think that would be amazing. I am kind of apprehensive and scared because already with my smart devices, I sometimes am feel like being tracked.</p>
        <p><b>What features are you expecting?</b></p>
        <p>I would like to see data on my health, and tips how to improve it, as well as my dancing, with specific metrics. If I tried it, I could use it on my students to help them. I also want to see the data in an easy and digestible form.</p>
