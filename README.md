# Dance-Health-Phase-1

DanceHealth is a student-led project that aims to create software for the Kinect 2 Camera and the Apple Watch using the depth camera and skeletal tracking as well as Apple HealthKit data to evaluate health metrics and skill.

We are currently deep into the development stage of our project.
